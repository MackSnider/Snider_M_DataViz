You will also need to a very minimal understanding on how the Winter Olympic Games work

### Allegiance

While I absolutely love Canada, I thought I would look and compare a different country. Canada usually dominates the Winter Olympis so I thought it would be fun to focus this assignment on one of the less dominante countries.
